# Project conventions

Path of Exile 2 memory-reading / overlay tool. C# on .NET 10, ImGui for the overlay,
WebView2 for configuration, Native AOT for shipping. A ground-up rewrite of the AutoHotkey
v2 tool, not a port of its structure.

## Never guess — read the reference

**When something about the game's memory or rendering is unclear, OPEN THE REFERENCE
before forming a theory.** This is the single most important rule here, and ignoring it has
already cost real time on this project.

- **`Gordin/GameHelper2`** (branch `main`) is the authority. It is a working tool against
  the same game, so its code answers questions that guessing cannot. Fetch the actual file:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gordin/GameHelper2/main/<path>`.
  Especially useful: `GameHelper/RemoteObjects/States/InGameStateObjects/WorldData.cs`
  (the world-to-screen projection), `Plugins/Radar/` (the map projection and its Helper),
  `Plugins/HealthBars/` (how to place something over an entity), and
  `GameOffsets/` (struct layouts).
- **The AHK tool** (`imm0r/PoEformance`, `ahk/`) is battle-tested against PoE2 specifically
  and carries drift history the upstream does not. Its `CLAUDE.md` is a long record of
  problems already solved.
- Do not trust a summarised directory listing over the real thing. A tree summary once
  reported "no Radar plugin" for a repo that plainly has one, and that wrong answer was
  taken at face value.

What guessing produced, for the record: a matrix invariant that rejected the correct offset
and accepted a decoy; a projection "proven" by a check that a wrong matrix passes trivially;
a 52-pixel offset explained by an invented theory about HUD framing; markers moved onto
`TerrainHeight`, which belongs to a different coordinate system entirely; and a hand-written
parser for the game's key bindings that missed both the `Input_flask_4_primary` spelling and
the fact that a numeric value is a decimal VIRTUAL-KEY CODE (`81` is Q, not the 8 and 1
keys). Each was a one-minute lookup away.

The game's own files are reference material too, not just the two projects above. The flask
keys live in `poe2_production_Config.ini`, so the tool reads them rather than assuming the
default 1-5 layout — the assumption looks correct until someone rebinds, and then the only
symptom is that nothing happens.

## The two screen-space systems

The game projects to the screen in **two independent ways**, and mixing them up looks
exactly like a bug in the other one:

1. **The 3D world** — `WorldData.WorldToScreen(position, height)`, driven by the camera
   matrix at `WorldData + 0x1A0`. Clip components are dots with COLUMNS of the flat array.
   Entity positions come from `Render.WorldPosition`; its `Z` is the entity's BASE, and
   `Z - ModelBounds.Z` is where the game floats the health bar.
2. **The in-game map** — no matrix at all. A fixed 38.7-degree isometric transform whose
   scale comes from the map UI element's own zoom and shift. See the block comment above
   `ImportantUiElements` in `schema/poe2.offsets.json` for the formula.

Markers from (1) will never line up with the markers the game draws in (2), because the map
is zoomable. Comparing them is what makes a correct projection look broken.

## Verify against the game, not against yourself

A check that a wrong value passes is worse than no check. Prefer tests the game itself can
settle:

- Project an entity's health-bar height and see whether it lands on the bar the game drew.
  That is a pixel-accurate reference, supplied free, on every monster on screen.
- For the camera matrix, require the player to be centred **and** the rest of the scene to
  spread out proportionally (`MatrixHunt`). Centring alone is satisfied by any matrix that
  inflates `w`, which collapses the whole scene onto one point.
- Structural fingerprints (a unit-length row, a plausible pointer) are weak. Frustum planes,
  basis blocks and inverse transforms all look like matrices.

## Offsets are data

`schema/poe2.offsets.json` is the reverse-engineering knowledge of this project. Edit it,
hot-reload with `--watch`, no rebuild. Every field may declare an invariant; the drift report
runs them at attach time. Record WHY an offset is what it is, and its drift history — that is
the part that is expensive to rediscover.

## Record, then diagnose offline

`--record` captures every read into a small file that replays without the game. Recordings
are the reason offsets can be diagnosed from Linux, and committed ones under `tests/fixtures/`
are regression tests against real memory. A recording can only contain reads the running
build actually performed, so a new diagnostic needs a fresh recording.

## Style

- Layering is compiler-enforced: Core → Game → Features → Overlay/Config → App. Nothing
  reaches backwards.
- Comments explain WHY, especially where a subtlety cost time. Do not narrate what the code
  already says.
- Analyzers are on and warnings are errors in spirit: keep the build at zero warnings.
- Chat may be German; everything committed is English.
